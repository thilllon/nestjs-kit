A NestJS integration for [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com), built on an independently reviewed specification.

> **Scope of 1.0.0.** This release covers HTTP: the Nest authentication kernel, the Better Auth construction plugin, the Express and Fastify platforms, and the admin, organization and API-key authorization units. GraphQL, WebSocket and RPC transports and the conformance testing kit are not included; they arrive in later minor versions behind their own entry points.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add nestjs-slightly-better-auth better-auth
```

Peer dependencies: `@nestjs/common` and `@nestjs/core` 12, `better-auth` 1.7.5 or newer, `reflect-metadata` and `rxjs`. Node.js 24.11 or newer.

## What this release covers

The library separates a Better Auth construction plugin, a NestJS integration kernel and optional transports. The `./plugin` entry installs the hook and cookie bridge before Better Auth creates its pipeline. The `./platform` entry provides Node/Web request and response helpers. Neither entry requires Express, Fastify, GraphQL or WebSocket packages.

The root entry provides synchronous and asynchronous module registration, default and named instances, service readers, guards, scoped execution and compositional authorization. Tests exercise actual Nest dependency injection and Better Auth sessions, including isolation between instances, caller-origin enforcement and application shutdown. Built ESM and CommonJS consumers verify the same registration and type contracts.

The `./express` and `./fastify` entries connect native Nest applications to Better Auth. Their end-to-end tests cover raw bodies, size limits, cookies, CORS, request cancellation, exception filters and real authentication. Fastify also supports HTTP/2. The platform entries have no runtime imports of Express or Fastify; install the Nest platform adapter used by your application.

Express preserves native controller parsing for unconditional routes that overlap the auth mount. Body-capable controller routes that also depend on host or non-URI version conditions are rejected at startup with `CONDITIONAL_ROUTE_SHADOW`; move them outside the auth mount. The integration checks the effective Express router flags because changing application settings after router creation does not change existing route matching. This is a tested Express 5 compatibility boundary, not an inspection of the router stack.

Fastify does not expose its configured `trustProxy` value through a public inspection API. The boot summary therefore reports proxy trust as `unknown`, and diagnostics that depend on the setting are unavailable. Client IP resolution still uses the native Fastify request. Configure proxy trust on your Nest Fastify adapter and verify it against your deployment topology.

GraphQL, WebSocket and microservice integrations have separate implementation and end-to-end acceptance gates. They will use optional entry points so applications can install the transports they use. HTTP platform tests do not establish that those integrations are ready.

Start with the [design workspace](docs/design/README.md), [reviewed specification](docs/design/design-v7.md), [review ledger](docs/design/ledger.md) and [implementation plan](../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-21-better-auth.md). Independent Better Auth, NestJS and security reviews approved the final v7 snapshot after resolving the round-6 and round-7 findings. The remaining entry points are tracked in [issue #534](https://github.com/thilllon/nestjs-kit/issues/534).

## Develop in this monorepo

From the repository root:

```sh
mise install
mise exec -- pnpm install
mise exec -- pnpm --filter nestjs-slightly-better-auth typecheck
mise exec -- pnpm --filter nestjs-slightly-better-auth build
mise exec -- pnpm test:packaging
```

The shared toolchain uses Node.js LTS, pnpm, tsdown, TypeScript and Vitest. Builds produce ESM and CommonJS artifacts with declarations. The `module-sync` export makes supported Node `import` and `require()` consumers share the same ESM module identity.

## Examples

The [Express](../../examples/better-auth-express/README.md) and [Fastify](../../examples/better-auth-fastify/README.md) example applications register a default and a named instance, guard routes and read the signed-in user through a principal parameter. They start without external services.

## Releases

Versions come from Changesets, and publication runs from the monorepo's release workflow with npm trusted publishing and provenance; see [release automation](../../docs/releases.md). New entry points are additive, so they ship as minor versions.
